1. One sentence desc: Online Translation Dictionary, look up word get translation and definition
2. What it will look like: home page with entry box where you can input word and select language for immediate one word results with def.a navigatable online dictionary with words and translations. A more complete sentence structure translator (added post feature)
3. How it will run: Dictionary and direct word translation/ defenitions all held within a file and will be accessed by front end and displayed. Discussion of additions unknown to me. Sentence translation will require addition of grammar and rules that will dictate the order of words and the conjugation. I would guess javascript code that can be referenced by the input box to pass sentences as arguments.
